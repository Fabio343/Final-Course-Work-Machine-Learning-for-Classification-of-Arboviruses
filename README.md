# Final Course Work :  Machine Learning for Classification of Arboviruses

The project aims to develop a Machine Learning template in Python to classify features that define the severity of dengue patients, using data obtained from several health centers in Brazil through a larger project (Aborbios, linked to FMUSP).

The results of this development will be used to write a monograph to be submitted to the Department of Applied Mathematics of the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics at USP as a requirement for completion of the Bachelor's degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics with a specialization in Physiology and Biophysics.
